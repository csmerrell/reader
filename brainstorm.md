# Premium e-reader
Focused on features that add immersive value to a reading experience, but also a little bit of upselling capability with better connections to related products.

## Core Features (Demo)
1. Unlockable concept art as you read.
2. Interactive world maps
3. Wiki integration **with dynamic spoiler tags**
    * Topical community integration (e.g. reddit thread recommendations)
4. Community profiles for reading.
5. Individual author shop integration
6. Higher profit sharing to creators.

## Other possibilities
1. Improved annotations.
2. Author music playlists?
3. Audiobook integration.

## Concept Art
1. Multiple options for how it shows.
    * Goal is to tailor it to the reader's immersion comfort level.
    * Examples:
        * **Light-weight:** - A low-weight numerical counter/badge at the top of the screen that can be clicked to scroll back through all the content art you've read through in reverse order.
        * **Medium-weight: (Current industry standard)** - At the end of a chapter, all of your unlocked concept art shows up.
        * **Heavy-weight:** - When you advance past a page that has a concept art, your first page swipe triggers a soft animation alerting you to a piece of content art that was attached to that page.
2. A single piece can be referenced multiple times in the novel (unlike in print).
3. Additionally, filters and animations can be used to do partial revelations of a piece of art (e.g. as multiple pieces of an artifact are recovered, putting together a puzzle.)

### Author's tools
1. A formatting guideline with tags to attach concept art references freely within the text.

## Interactive World Maps
World maps with additional features:
1. Pathways & animations that can show where characters are traveling in any given scene or chapter.
    * These can be reader-configured similar to concept art, with light/heavy profile notifications when a map has a relevant update.
2. Connections to concept art pieces.
    * Concept art of your city's grand gates can be linked directly to the world map.
    * Or a point of interest where a major scene occured can be pinned to open up a more crucial scene piece of artwork.
3. World map icon can be readily accessible inside the reading screen, for quick reference (like in video games).

### Author's tools
1. Upload your map to the wiki, and get a coordinate selector that can spit out formatted annotations to drop in your book.
2. Save these annotations freely, with filters to keep track of them.

## Wiki Integration
An author/editor controllable wiki, but with (crucially) spoiler tag formatting implemented.

1. Can be referenced freely within the book with annotations. Can also be manually opened in a annotized reading sidebar.
2. Also integrates community-engaging tools:
    * Recommend popular reddit threads discussing fan theories and insights on a particular topic.
    * ???
3. "Word of Brandon" integration

**Important callout**
Advanced wikis could have huge potential for Pen and Paper RPG communities if attached to a premium digital core rulebook.

### Author's tools
Basically the kind of stuff you'd get editing a wiki.

## Community Profiles
These would basically be fan-curated profiles with reference link annotations that can bring additional context to re-reads of a favorite novel.

1. Open to community voting and curation.
2. Can also get an author's recommendation.
3. A reader can stack multiple of these from fans that may have specialized in referencing different things.

### Author's tools
Not much needed here.

## Author Shop Integration
Where other reading platforms will only let you link to your other products within their controlled ecosystem, we can allow independent/small authors to include recommendations and links to their own preferred storefronts where they can maximize profits for their own independent work.

1. Authors are still left to create their own websites (squarespace, etc). Other platforms choose which of your books will get recommended to their readers. We'll let authors add configuration.
2. Possibly add a sort of feedback mini-survey which an author can use to recommend different books as their next suggestion.
    * "Standalone story" could lead an author to prioritize one of their novellas.
    * "Hard magic system"
    * Political intrigue
    * etc.

## Profit sharing
We can add value to independent authors by giving them greater share of their profits, as the major players don't actually need the 30% (or more) cut they're taking to provide a digital storefront.
